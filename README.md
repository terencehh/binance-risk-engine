Rationale

Over 95% of traders lose money. I realized its not due to a lack of strategy that makes traders lose money, its usually the emotional sides of fear & greed which cause people to make stupid decisions like overtrading, overrisking on positions etc. Personally, I have experienced these struggles myself and its very hard to control some of these reasons due to human weakness of fear & greed. This project aims to address the risk side by ensuring a traders account can never blow up with a risk engine script.
